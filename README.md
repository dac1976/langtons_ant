# Langton's Ant Simulator #
## Overview ##
For some time I have wanted to learn the Rust programming language. I've toyed with the idea on and off for the last 2 years. At long last I made the effort to write a non-trivial, but still simple project, to get to grips with the fundamentals.

Hence, I decided to do my own implementation of [Langton's Ant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton%27s_ant). My version includes the extension to multiple colours, one randomly chosen colour per direction in the defined movment rule.

The project creates a simple console application that prompts the user for input of control parameters.

The code makes use of core standard Rust library code as well as the Piston crate to provide access to a 2D graphical rendering window.
